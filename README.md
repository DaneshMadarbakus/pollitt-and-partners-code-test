#Pollit & Partners Code Test

##Approach

<li>First set up my enovironment by npm installing the relevant SASS and gulp packages and added a gulpfile to run a simple file to watch for any changes in my sass files and automatically create a css file on save (this makes the development process run a lot smoother) 

<li>Added bootstrap as I realised its grid system would come in handy in making the page responsive later down the line 

<li>Added all relevant content into an html file 

<li>Created a main SCSS file for me to import all other relevant SCSS files 

<li>Created specific SCSS files for variables, typography and structure so that I could start development would run smoother and so that if later on down the line I could change the colour theme and fonts very easliy as they have been assigned variables 

<li>Started designing the different parts of the webpage including: footer, header, main, and section 

<li>Finished by making the design responsive
